## 🧠 Why EzApply?

Job hunting is painful for ADHD brains: object permanence issues lead to 50+ open tabs, "apply later" becomes "never apply," and the lack of immediate feedback kills motivation.

**EzApply** fixes this by:
1.  **Reducing Friction**: One-click capture from LinkedIn & Indeed.
2.  **Preventing Hoarding**: Limits your "Inbox" to **10 jobs**—you *must* apply or delete to add more.
3.  **Gamification**: Visual Kanban board with **confetti celebrations** 🎉 to hack your dopamine reward system.

## ✨ Key Features (v1.2)

### 🕵️‍♂️ Smart Capture
* **Auto-Sync**: Automatically detects job details (Title, Company, URL) when you switch tabs or click new jobs on **LinkedIn** & **Indeed**.
* **Manual Override**: Auto-capture failed? Just **highlight the text** on the page and click refresh.
* **Notes**: Add salary, tech stack, or deadlines instantly.

### 📋 Visual Workflow
* **Anti-Hoarding Inbox**: Hard limit of 10 jobs. forces decision-making.
* **Kanban Board**: Drag & Drop interface (Inbox → Applied → Archive).
* **One-Click Declutter**: Overwhelmed by old applications? Use the **"Clear Archive"** button to instantly wipe your history and get a fresh start—guilt-free.
* **Dopamine Hits**: Smooth animations and confetti effects when you move cards to "Applied".

### 🛡️ Privacy First
* **Local Storage**: All data lives 100% in your browser (`chrome.storage.local`).
* **No Servers**: We don't collect, track, or sell your data.
